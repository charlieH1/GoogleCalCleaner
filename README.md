# GoogleCalCleaner
Very basic comand line project for deleting all events in a google calendar
To do this you will need the calendar ID which can be fetched by searching through the source in dev tools when loading a event (search for the name of the calendar)
An access token (also refered to as a bearer token) can be fetched either from copying from the reuests from here https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/delete or from here https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ having selected https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events under the google calendar in step 1 on that page
